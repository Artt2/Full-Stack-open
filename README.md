# Full Stack Open

Repository for University of Helsinki's Full Stack Open course, see [here](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) for more.

*"Learn **React**, **Redux**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, **GraphQL** and **TypeScript** in one go! This course will introduce you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js."*

The course extends its scope to include parts about **React Native**, Continuous Integration/Continuous Development and Containers (**Docker**).

Each part of the course introduces new concepts and puts your skills to the test with exercises that gradually build up to create a complete application. The course includes mini projects and projects that span across several parts. Most projects are built up from scratch, some have a ready-made backend/frontend implementation. 

The size of the course is 14 ECTS, with a workload of ~+350 hours.
